# Compress_file
This repository contains a C++ implementation of Huffman coding for file compression. Huffman coding is a popular algorithm for lossless data compression, where each character in the input file is assigned a variable-length binary code based on its frequency of occurrence. This results in a more efficient representation of the data, reducing the overall file size.

This repository provides a simple and clear implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in C++. It includes both encoding (compressing) and decoding (decompressing) functionalities.
